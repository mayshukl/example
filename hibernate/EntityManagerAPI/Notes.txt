1. When will insert SQL statement get executed?
   1. EntityManager#persist
   2. EntityManager#getTransaction#commit

   Sql Statement will get fired at the time of persist only if id is getting generated in database
   otherwise sql insert will get fired at the time of commit.

   Main Purpose of persist method is getting Id of entity at time of insert.

2. If we modify already persisted entity, an additional update statement will get fired.

3. Difference between EntityManager#find and EntityManager#getReference
    find will query from db if entity is not present in cache.
    getReference return a proxy object.

4. EntityManager#Remove - delete the entity.
5. hibernate.use_identifier_rollback --> reset the identifier value in case of removal
5. EntityManager#Refresh - discard the new changes on detached entity. Load it from db
6. EntityManager#Merge - Load or create new entity from db and apply the changes made on detached entity.

7. javax.persistence.Query --< this interface provide the option to readonly entities . There wil not allow any update on fetched entity.This is a bit faster also.
                               This does not do dirty checking.

8 Synchronization occurs in following events
  1. TXN#commit
  2. Query#list not entityManager#find
  3. entityManager#flush

  This can be customized by setting entityManager#setFlushMode.

9. entityManager#unwrap gives underlying implementation of session.
